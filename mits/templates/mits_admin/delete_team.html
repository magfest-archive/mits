<h2>Delete {{ team.name }}</h2>

This will delete this team's application.  The most common reason for this is when a team fills out the form
multiple times.  In that case you should select which of the other applications this is a duplicate of, since
then when someone tries to log into that application we can automatically redirect them to the correct application.

<br/> <br/>

{% if matching_teams %}
    We have <b>{{ match_count }} other non-deleted application{{ match_count|pluralize }}<b>
    with the same name as this one (<i>{{ team.name }}</i>), so you should probably select one of those.
{% else %}
    There are no other non-deleted applications with the same name as this one.  Therefore you probably want to
    just mark this as deleted without selecting one of those applications as a duplicate.

If applicable, select the duplicate team from the following list:
